Your project should include a README file containing the following information:

1. the libraries required to run the project including the full version of each library
Python==3.10
numpy==2.1.3
opencv_python==4.10.0

2. how to run each task and where to look for the output file.

To run the project, you need to run each cell in the 341_Balaita_Cosmin.ipynb file.
In the second cell you will have to change the path_folder_joc to the path of the folder containing the files from the antrenare folder.
Also you will have to make sure that path_backgroud="../../../imagini_auxiliare/01.jpg" is the path to the background image.(background image is the image that does not contain any pieces on the board)

The output files will be saved in the path described by path_solutie (second cell).

Task 1 and Task 2 will execute in the same cell and the output will be saved in the path described by path_solutie
For task 3 you will have to run the last 2 cells and the output will be saved in the path described by path_solutie

For the output files you will have to look in the folder described by path_solutie.

3. the name of the output file for each task:
Task 1 and Task 2 will have the same output file named [i].txt where i is  the name of the image file.
Task 3 will have the output file named [i]_scores.txt where i is the round of the game
